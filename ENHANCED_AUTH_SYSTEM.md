# Enhanced Authentication & Authorization System

## Overview

I have successfully extended the existing authentication/authorization system with comprehensive role-based access control and account status management.

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. Role Hierarchy
- **Basic** → Features: Create, Survey, Analytics
- **Premium** → All basic features + Postback, Pass/Fail
- **Enterprise** → All premium features + Test Lab
- **Admin** → All features + Admin Panel, User Management

### 2. Account Status Management
- **Approved** → User can log in normally
- **Disapproved** → Block login with message: "Your account is not approved. Please contact your manager or support team."
- **Locked** → Block login with message: "Your account is under review. Please contact your manager."

### 3. Backend Components

#### Core Files Created/Updated:
- `role_manager.py` - Central role and feature management system
- `feature_middleware.py` - Feature-based access control decorators
- `role_status_migration.py` - Database migration script
- `auth_service.py` - Updated with status checking and role management
- `admin_routes.py` - Enhanced with role/status management endpoints
- `auth_routes.py` - Added permissions endpoint

#### Key Backend Features:
- Role hierarchy with feature mapping
- Status-based login blocking
- JWT tokens with embedded permissions
- Admin APIs for user role/status management
- Bulk user management operations
- Feature-based route protection

### 4. Frontend Components

#### Files Created:
- `FeatureGuard.tsx` - React components for role-based UI protection
- Updated `AuthContext.tsx` - Enhanced with permissions management

#### Frontend Features:
- `<FeatureGuard>` - Hide/show UI based on feature access
- `<RoleGuard>` - Hide/show UI based on role hierarchy
- `<AdminGuard>` - Admin-only UI components
- `useFeatureAccess()` - Hook for checking permissions in components

### 5. API Endpoints

#### New Authentication Endpoints:
```
GET /api/auth/permissions - Get user permissions and features
```

#### Enhanced Admin Endpoints:
```
PUT /api/admin/users/{id}/role - Update user role
PUT /api/admin/users/{id}/status - Update user status
PUT /api/admin/users/bulk-update - Bulk update users
GET /api/admin/roles - Get role hierarchy and feature mapping
```

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
cd Backend
python role_status_migration.py
```

### 2. Update Environment Variables
Ensure your `.env` file has the required JWT configuration:
```
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Backend dependencies should already be installed. If needed:
```bash
pip install pymongo bcrypt python-jose flask-cors
```

### 4. Frontend Integration
Import and use the new components in your React app:

```tsx
import { FeatureGuard, RoleGuard, AdminGuard, useFeatureAccess } from './components/FeatureGuard';

// Hide features based on user role
<FeatureGuard feature="postback">
  <PostbackManager />
</FeatureGuard>

// Show admin-only content
<AdminGuard>
  <AdminDashboard />
</AdminGuard>

// Use in components
const { hasFeature, hasRole, canAccessAdmin } = useFeatureAccess();
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Create Test Users:**
   - Register new users (they get 'basic' role by default)
   - Use admin interface to promote users to different roles

2. **Test Role Hierarchy:**
   - Basic user: Should only see Create, Survey, Analytics
   - Premium user: Should also see Postback, Pass/Fail
   - Enterprise user: Should also see Test Lab
   - Admin user: Should see everything + Admin Panel

3. **Test Status Management:**
   - Set user status to 'disapproved' → Should block login
   - Set user status to 'locked' → Should block login with different message
   - Set user status to 'approved' → Should allow normal login

4. **Test Admin Controls:**
   - Admin should be able to change any user's role
   - Admin should be able to change any user's status
   - Bulk operations should work for multiple users

### Automated Testing:
```bash
cd Backend
python test_role_system.py
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Role Feature Mapping
Edit `role_manager.py` to modify the role hierarchy or add new features:

```python
ROLE_FEATURES: Dict[UserRole, Set[Feature]] = {
    UserRole.BASIC: {Feature.CREATE, Feature.SURVEY, Feature.ANALYTICS},
    UserRole.PREMIUM: {Feature.CREATE, Feature.SURVEY, Feature.ANALYTICS, Feature.POSTBACK, Feature.PASS_FAIL},
    # Add new roles or features here
}
```

### Status Messages
Customize blocked user messages in `role_manager.py`:

```python
STATUS_MESSAGES: Dict[UserStatus, StatusMessage] = {
    UserStatus.DISAPPROVED: StatusMessage(
        title="Account Not Approved",
        message="Your custom message here"
    ),
}
```

## 🔐 Security Features

- **JWT Token Security**: Tokens include role, status, and features
- **Status Validation**: Login blocked for non-approved users
- **Feature-based Access**: Routes protected by specific features
- **Admin Protection**: Admin functions require admin role
- **Session Management**: Tokens expire after 7 days

## 📊 Admin Dashboard Features

Admins can now:
- View all users with their roles and statuses
- Change user roles (basic/premium/enterprise/admin)
- Change user account status (approved/disapproved/locked)
- Bulk update multiple users at once
- View system statistics and role hierarchy

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Backend Route Protection:
```python
from feature_middleware import requireFeature, requireRole

@app.route('/api/postback')
@requireFeature('postback')
def postback_endpoint():
    # Only users with postback feature can access
    pass

@app.route('/api/admin/users')
@requireRole('admin')
def admin_users():
    # Only admin users can access
    pass
```

### Frontend Component Protection:
```tsx
// Show different content based on role
<RoleGuard role="premium" fallback={<UpgradePrompt />}>
  <PostbackSettings />
</RoleGuard>

// Check permissions in component logic
const { hasFeature } = useFeatureAccess();

if (hasFeature('test_lab')) {
  // Show test lab functionality
}
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Default Role**: New users get 'basic' role and 'approved' status by default
2. **Admin Protection**: System prevents deleting the last admin user
3. **Token Refresh**: Users need to log in again to get updated permissions after role changes
4. **Database Migration**: Run the migration script before deploying to production
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing users will be migrated to 'basic' role with 'approved' status

## 🔄 Migration from Old System

The system is backward compatible:
- Existing 'user' roles → migrated to 'basic'
- Existing 'admin' roles → remain 'admin'
- All existing users → get 'approved' status
- All existing functionality → continues to work

This enhanced authentication system provides a solid foundation for role-based access control that can easily be extended with new roles and features as your application grows.
