# üéØ How the Floating Widget Works - Complete Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start & Testing

### **1. Launch the Application**
Your development server should be running at: **http://localhost:5173**

### **2. Access the Test Lab**
- Go to the main page (http://localhost:5173)
- In the "Create" tab, find the "Floating Widget Demo" section
- Click the **"üß™ Open Test Lab"** button
- Or directly visit: **http://localhost:5173/widget-test**

### **3. Test Methods**

#### **Method A: Natural Behavior (Recommended)**
1. **Scroll around the test page** to increase scroll percentage
2. **Click on the interactive cards** to increase interaction count
3. **Stop moving your mouse for 5+ seconds** (this triggers idle detection)
4. **Widget appears automatically** based on your behavior

#### **Method B: Manual Control**
1. Go back to the main page
2. Use the manual controls in the "Floating Widget Demo" section
3. Click "Show Widget" to force display

## üìä Behavior Tracking & Display Logic

### **Real-Time Metrics Tracked:**
- **Time on page**: How long user has been on current page
- **Scroll percentage**: Maximum scroll depth reached (0-100%)
- **Click count**: Total interactions/clicks
- **Idle time**: Time since last mouse/keyboard activity
- **Engagement score**: Calculated 0-100 based on all metrics
- **User intent**: Categorized as exploring/engaged/leaving/focused

### **When Widget Appears:**
```
Base Conditions:
‚úÖ User has been idle for 5+ seconds
‚úÖ Widget hasn't been shown before (or dismissed > 7 days ago)
‚úÖ User intent is not "leaving"

Smart Timing:
üéØ High engagement (60+ score) + 15+ seconds on page = Show earlier
üéØ 30%+ scroll + some interaction = Optimal timing
üéØ 45+ seconds on any page = Show regardless
```

## üí¨ Question Flow & Personalization

### **Question 1: Mood Assessment** *(Immediate)*
```
"How are you feeling about your experience so far?"

Response Options:
ü§© Amazing    üòä Good    üòê Okay    üò§ Frustrated
```

**Personalization Logic:**
- If user spent 60+ seconds: *"You've been here for a while! How are you feeling...?"*
- Default: Standard question

### **Question 2: Engagement Focus** *(1.5 second delay)*
```
"What's keeping you most engaged right now?"

Response Options:
üìù Content quality    üé® Design & interface    ‚ö° Features    üîç Just exploring
```

**Personalization Logic:**
- If scroll > 80%: *"You've explored quite a bit! What's keeping you most engaged?"*
- Default: Standard question

### **Question 3: Recommendation Likelihood** *(1.5 second delay)*
```
"How likely are you to recommend this to a friend?"

Response Options:
Scale: Not at all ‚Üí Unlikely ‚Üí Maybe ‚Üí Likely ‚Üí Definitely!
```

**Personalization Logic:**
- If clicks > 10: *"You're really active here! How likely are you to recommend...?"*
- Default: Standard question

## üé® Personalized Content Engine

After all questions are answered, the widget shows personalized content based on responses:

### **Content Matrix:**

| User Response Combination | Content Type | Title | CTA |
|---------------------------|--------------|-------|-----|
| **Amazing** + **Definitely!** | Upgrade | "You're awesome! üåü" | "Explore Premium" |
| **Frustrated** OR **Not at all** | Support | "We hear you üíô" | "Get Help" |
| **Engagement = Content** | Content Rec. | "Great taste! üìö" | "See More Content" |
| **Default/Other** | General | "Thanks for sharing! üôè" | "Discover More" |

## ‚è∞ Timing & Auto-Dismiss Logic

### **Progressive Timing:**
```
Widget Appears ‚Üí Question 1 (immediate)
                     ‚Üì (1.5s delay)
                 Question 2
                     ‚Üì (1.5s delay)  
                 Question 3
                     ‚Üì (1s delay)
                 Thank You Screen
                     ‚Üì (1s delay)
                 Personalized Content
```

### **Auto-Dismiss Rules:**
- **45 seconds** total timeout (widget disappears if no interaction)
- **Escape key** dismisses widget
- **Close button** dismisses widget
- **Clicking CTA** completes and dismisses

---

## üíæ Persistence & Memory

### **LocalStorage Keys:**
```javascript
'floatingWidgetCompleted' ‚Üí 'true' (prevents reshowing)
'floatingWidgetResponses' ‚Üí JSON responses (for analytics)
'floatingWidgetDismissed' ‚Üí {timestamp, metrics} (7-day cooldown)
```

### **Reset for Testing:**
```javascript
// Clear widget memory (paste in browser console)
localStorage.removeItem('floatingWidgetCompleted');
localStorage.removeItem('floatingWidgetDismissed');
localStorage.removeItem('floatingWidgetResponses');
location.reload();
```

---

## üé≠ Visual Design & Animations

### **Appearance Animation:**
- Slides up from bottom-right
- Scale + opacity transition (0.3s ease-out)
- Backdrop blur glass effect

### **Question Transitions:**
- Slide left/right between questions
- Scale animations on button hover/tap
- Progress bar fills smoothly

### **Theme Integration:**
- Respects light/dark mode automatically
- Uses your existing red color scheme
- Matches Poppins font family
- Tailwind CSS responsive design

## üîß Development Features

### **Debug Panel** *(Development only)*
Located in top-left corner when running locally:
- Live behavior metrics
- Engagement score
- User intent classification  
- Current responses
- Widget state

### **Console Logging:**
```javascript
// Widget completion
‚úÖ Widget completed with responses: {mood: "amazing", engagement: "content", likelihood: "5"}

// Widget dismissal  
‚ùå Widget dismissed
```

---

## üéØ Real-World Integration

### **Analytics Integration:**
```javascript
const handleWidgetComplete = async (responses) => {
  // Send to your analytics platform
  await analytics.track('widget_completed', {
    responses,
    userBehavior: behavior,
    engagementScore,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  });
  
  // Send to your backend
  await fetch('/api/widget-responses', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(responses)
  });
};
```

### **Personalization API:**
```javascript
// Use responses to customize user experience
if (responses.mood === 'amazing' && responses.likelihood === '5') {
  // Show premium upgrade prompts
  showUpgradeModal();
} else if (responses.mood === 'frustrated') {
  // Trigger support chat
  openSupportChat();
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Widget Not Appearing?**
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify you're on a supported route (not /survey/:id)
3. Clear localStorage and refresh
4. Try manual "Show Widget" button
5. Check debug panel metrics

### **Questions Not Personalizing?**
1. Increase time on page (60+ seconds)
2. Scroll more (80%+ depth)  
3. Click more elements (10+ clicks)
4. Check behavior metrics in debug panel

### **Auto-dismiss Too Fast?**
- Default is 45 seconds
- Modify `AUTO_DISMISS_DELAY` in `FloatingWidget.tsx`
- Or disable auto-dismiss entirely
